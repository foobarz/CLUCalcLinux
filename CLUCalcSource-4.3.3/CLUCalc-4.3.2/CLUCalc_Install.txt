This text will give some help on compiling and
installing CLUCalc.

Be aware that the CLUCalc sources are distributed
under the GNU General Public License. This implies that
you MUST NOT use CLUCalc or any part of it in
proprietry software. The full license text can be
found in the file 'license.txt' distributed with
this package.


Before you build CLUCalc 4.3.2 you need to build the
following libraries in this order:

   1. CLUfltk 1.1.5, the CLU version of FLTK
   2. CLULibs 2.3.0, which includes CLU, CLUDraw and CLUParse

Both may be downloaded from www.clucalc.info. 

See further down for how to prepare a proper 
environment for the CLUCalc binary.


Windows Install
===============

Load the CLUCalc.sln workspace with Visual Studio .NET and
build CLUCalc. That's it.


Linux Install
=============

You have to make sure that pkg-config is
installed on your system and that the environment
variable PKG_CONFIG_PATH contains the path 

   ${CLU_HOME}/lib/pgkconfig

If everything is ready a simple call to

   ./BUILD

should do the trick. You will find the CLUCalc binary
under '${CLU_HOME}/bin'. 


CLUCalc environment
===================

The first time you start up CLUCalc, it won't show the
Latex rendered text. To generate the appropriate bitmaps
select 'Parse (force render latex)' from the 'Code' menu.
The bitmaps generated are called '_title.rlb' and '_web.rlb',
and will appear in the same directory as the CLUCalc binary.
From now on when you start CLUCalc, it will show the bitmaps
right away.

If you want to use the help feature, you will also need to
generate and install the html help files. For this purpose
you need to install 'doxygen' on your system. Then change
into the 'CLUCalcDoc' subdirectory of the CLUCalc sources
and edit the 'doxygen.ini' file. Look for the entry 'INPUT'
and set the path to the CLUScript document doxygen files.
If you have the CLU libraries installed under

   /home/foo/CLUProject/CLULibs-2.3.0

then the path you want is

   /home/foo/CLUProject/CLULibs-2.3.0/CLUParse/CLUScriptDoc/

Once you have modified the doxygen.ini file execute

   doxygen doxygen.ini

You should now have the html documentation files under

   CLUCalc/doc/html

In order to make them accessible through CLUCalc, copy them
to a sub-directory named 'Documentation' in the directory
where the CLUCalc binary lies.

That's all!
