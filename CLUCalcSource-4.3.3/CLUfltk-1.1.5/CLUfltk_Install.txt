This is some help on how to install and compile CLUfltk.

You can basically follow the description in the appropriate
README file for your system. 

Windows Install
===============

Open the 'fltk.sln' file in the 'visualc' subdirectory
with Visual Studio .NET, and build all projects
in debug and release mode. That's all.


Linux Install
=============

First of all, set the environment variable 
FLTK_HOME to the CLUfltk directory. For example,
if CLUfltk is installed under

   /home/foo/CLUProject/CLUfltk-1.1.5

then this should also be the path contained in FLTK_HOME.

You should now install CLUfltk to the FLTK_HOME directory.
To do this simply execute the following commands from within
the CLUfltk directory.

	  ./configure --prefix=${FLTK_HOME}
	  make install
	  make

Note that at least on my setup make install returns with an error
after compiling and installing everything. And somehow it has
deleted the main fltk library again. But if you execute 'make'
again then everything is ok.

Alternatively you can also simply excute the script BUILD from
within the CLUfltk directory by typing
	
	./BUILD

Make sure that FLTK_HOME is defined in the shell you are using.
